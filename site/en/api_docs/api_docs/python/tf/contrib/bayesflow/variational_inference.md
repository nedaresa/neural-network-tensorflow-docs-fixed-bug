# Module: tf.contrib.bayesflow.variational_inference



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/bayesflow/python/ops/variational_inference.py`](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.4/tensorflow/contrib/bayesflow/python/ops/variational_inference.py).

Variational inference.

See the ${@python/contrib.bayesflow.variational_inference} guide.

## Classes

[`class ELBOForms`](../../../tf/contrib/bayesflow/variational_inference/ELBOForms): Constants to control the `elbo` calculation.

## Functions

[`elbo(...)`](../../../tf/contrib/bayesflow/variational_inference/elbo): Evidence Lower BOund. `log p(x) >= ELBO`.

[`elbo_with_log_joint(...)`](../../../tf/contrib/bayesflow/variational_inference/elbo_with_log_joint): Evidence Lower BOund. `log p(x) >= ELBO`.

[`register_prior(...)`](../../../tf/contrib/bayesflow/variational_inference/register_prior): Associate a variational `StochasticTensor` with a `Distribution` prior.
