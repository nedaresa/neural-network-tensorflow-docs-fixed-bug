Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/keras/python/keras/backend.py`](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.3/tensorflow/contrib/keras/python/keras/backend.py).

Iterates over the time dimension of a tensor.

#### Arguments:

    step_function: RNN step function.
        Parameters;
            input; tensor with shape `(samples, ...)` (no time dimension),
                representing input for the batch of samples at a certain
                time step.
            states; list of tensors.
        Returns;
            output; tensor with shape `(samples, output_dim)`
                (no time dimension).
            new_states; list of tensors, same length and shapes
                as 'states'. The first state in the list must be the
                output tensor at the previous timestep.
    inputs: tensor of temporal data of shape `(samples, time, ...)`
        (at least 3D).
    initial_states: tensor with shape (samples, output_dim)
        (no time dimension),
        containing the initial values for the states used in
        the step function.
    go_backwards: boolean. If True, do the iteration over the time
        dimension in reverse order and return the reversed sequence.
    mask: binary tensor with shape `(samples, time, 1)`,
        with a zero for every element that is masked.
    constants: a list of constant values passed at each step.
    unroll: whether to unroll the RNN or to use a symbolic loop
        (`while_loop` or `scan` depending on backend).


#### Returns:

    A tuple, `(last_output, outputs, new_states)`.
        last_output: the latest output of the rnn, of shape `(samples, ...)`
        outputs: tensor with shape `(samples, time, ...)` where each
            entry `outputs[s, t]` is the output of the step function
            at time `t` for sample `s`.
        new_states: list of tensors, latest states returned by
            the step function, of shape `(samples, ...)`.


#### Raises:

    ValueError: if input dimension is less than 3.
    ValueError: if `unroll` is `True` but input timestep is not a fixed
    number.
    ValueError: if `mask` is provided (not `None`) but states is not provided
        (`len(states)` == 0).
