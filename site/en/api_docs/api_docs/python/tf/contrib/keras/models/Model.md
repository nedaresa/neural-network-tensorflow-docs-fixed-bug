## Methods

<h3 id="__init__"><code>__init__</code></h3>

``` python
__init__(
    inputs,
    outputs,
    name=None
)
```



<h3 id="__call__"><code>__call__</code></h3>

``` python
__call__(
    inputs,
    **kwargs
)
```

Wrapper around self.call(), for handling internal references.

If a Keras tensor is passed:
    - We call self._add_inbound_node().
    - If necessary, we `build` the layer to match
        the shape of the input(s).
    - We update the _keras_history of the output tensor(s)
        with the current layer.
        This is done as part of _add_inbound_node().

#### Arguments:

    inputs: Can be a tensor or list/tuple of tensors.
    **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to be passed to `call()`.


#### Returns:

    Output of the layer's `call` method.


#### Raises:

    ValueError: in case the layer is missing shape information
        for its `build` call.

<h3 id="__deepcopy__"><code>__deepcopy__</code></h3>

``` python
__deepcopy__(memo)
```



<h3 id="add_loss"><code>add_loss</code></h3>

``` python
add_loss(
    losses,
    inputs=None
)
```

Add loss tensor(s), potentially dependent on layer inputs.

Some losses (for instance, activity regularization losses) may be dependent
on the inputs passed when calling a layer. Hence, when reusing a same layer
on different inputs `a` and `b`, some entries in `layer.losses` may be
dependent on `a` and some on `b`. This method automatically keeps track
of dependencies.

The `get_losses_for` method allows to retrieve the losses relevant to a
specific set of inputs.

#### Arguments:

* <b>`losses`</b>: Loss tensor, or list/tuple of tensors.
* <b>`inputs`</b>: Optional input tensor(s) that the loss(es) depend on. Must
    match the `inputs` argument passed to the `__call__` method at the time
    the losses are created. If `None` is passed, the losses are assumed
    to be unconditional, and will apply across all dataflows of the layer
    (e.g. weight regularization losses).

<h3 id="add_update"><code>add_update</code></h3>

``` python
add_update(
    updates,
    inputs=None
)
```

Add update op(s), potentially dependent on layer inputs.

Weight updates (for instance, the updates of the moving mean and variance
in a BatchNormalization layer) may be dependent on the inputs passed
when calling a layer. Hence, when reusing a same layer on
different inputs `a` and `b`, some entries in `layer.updates` may be
dependent on `a` and some on `b`. This method automatically keeps track
of dependencies.

The `get_updates_for` method allows to retrieve the updates relevant to a
specific set of inputs.

#### Arguments:

* <b>`updates`</b>: Update op, or list/tuple of update ops.
* <b>`inputs`</b>: Optional input tensor(s) that the update(s) depend on. Must
    match the `inputs` argument passed to the `__call__` method at the time
    the updates are created. If `None` is passed, the updates are assumed
    to be unconditional, and will apply across all dataflows of the layer.

<h3 id="add_variable"><code>add_variable</code></h3>

``` python
add_variable(
    name,
    shape,
    dtype=None,
    initializer=None,
    regularizer=None,
    trainable=True
)
```

Adds a new variable to the layer, or gets an existing one; returns it.

#### Arguments:

* <b>`name`</b>: variable name.
* <b>`shape`</b>: variable shape.
* <b>`dtype`</b>: The type of the variable. Defaults to `self.dtype`.
* <b>`initializer`</b>: initializer instance (callable).
* <b>`regularizer`</b>: regularizer instance (callable).
* <b>`trainable`</b>: whether the variable should be part of the layer's
    "trainable_variables" (e.g. variables, biases)
    or "non_trainable_variables" (e.g. BatchNorm mean, stddev).


#### Returns:

  The created variable.

<h3 id="add_weight"><code>add_weight</code></h3>

``` python
add_weight(
    name,
    shape,
    dtype=None,
    initializer=None,
    regularizer=None,
    trainable=True,
    constraint=None
)
```

Adds a weight variable to the layer.

#### Arguments:

    name: String, the name for the weight variable.
    shape: The shape tuple of the weight.
    dtype: The dtype of the weight.
    initializer: An Initializer instance (callable).
    regularizer: An optional Regularizer instance.
    trainable: A boolean, whether the weight should
        be trained via backprop or not (assuming
        that the layer itself is also trainable).
    constraint: An optional Constraint instance.


#### Returns:

    The created weight variable.

<h3 id="apply"><code>apply</code></h3>

``` python
apply(
    inputs,
    *args,
    **kwargs
)
```

Apply the layer on a input.

This simply wraps `self.__call__`.

#### Arguments:

* <b>`inputs`</b>: Input tensor(s).
  *args: additional positional arguments to be passed to `self.call`.
  **kwargs: additional keyword arguments to be passed to `self.call`.


#### Returns:

  Output tensor(s).

<h3 id="build"><code>build</code></h3>

``` python
build(input_shape)
```

Creates the layer weights.

Must be implemented on all layers that have weights.

#### Arguments:

    input_shape: Keras tensor (future input to layer)
        or list/tuple of Keras tensors to reference
        for weight shape computations.

<h3 id="call"><code>call</code></h3>

``` python
call(
    inputs,
    mask=None
)
```

Call the model on new inputs.

In this case `call` just reapplies
all ops in the graph to the new inputs
(e.g. build a new computational graph from the provided inputs).

A model is callable on non-Keras tensors.

#### Arguments:

    inputs: A tensor or list of tensors.
    mask: A mask or list of masks. A mask can be
        either a tensor or None (no mask).


#### Returns:

    A tensor if there is a single output, or
    a list of tensors if there are more than one outputs.

<h3 id="compile"><code>compile</code></h3>

``` python
compile(
    optimizer,
    loss,
    metrics=None,
    loss_weights=None,
    sample_weight_mode=None,
    **kwargs
)
```

Configures the model for training.

#### Arguments:

    optimizer: str (name of optimizer) or optimizer object.
        See [optimizers](/optimizers).
    loss: str (name of objective function) or objective function.
        See [losses](/losses).
        If the model has multiple outputs, you can use a different loss
        on each output by passing a dictionary or a list of losses.
        The loss value that will be minimized by the model
        will then be the sum of all individual losses.
    metrics: list of metrics to be evaluated by the model
        during training and testing.
        Typically you will use `metrics=['accuracy']`.
        To specify different metrics for different outputs of a
        multi-output model, you could also pass a dictionary,
        such as `metrics={'output_a': 'accuracy'}`.
    loss_weights: Optional list or dictionary specifying scalar
        coefficients (Python floats) to weight the loss contributions
        of different model outputs.
        The loss value that will be minimized by the model
        will then be the *weighted sum* of all individual losses,
        weighted by the `loss_weights` coefficients.
        If a list, it is expected to have a 1:1 mapping
        to the model's outputs. If a tensor, it is expected to map
        output names (strings) to scalar coefficients.
    sample_weight_mode: if you need to do timestep-wise
        sample weighting (2D weights), set this to `"temporal"`.
        `None` defaults to sample-wise weights (1D).
        If the model has multiple outputs, you can use a different
        `sample_weight_mode` on each output by passing a
        dictionary or a list of modes.
    **kwargs: Additional arguments passed to `tf.Session.run`.


#### Raises:

    ValueError: In case of invalid arguments for
        `optimizer`, `loss`, `metrics` or `sample_weight_mode`.
    RuntimeError: In case of ill-formulated optimization problem.

<h3 id="compute_mask"><code>compute_mask</code></h3>

compute_mask(
    inputs,
    mask
)
```



<h3 id="count_params"><code>count_params</code></h3>

``` python
count_params()
```

Count the total number of scalars composing the weights.

#### Returns:

    An integer count.


#### Raises:

    RuntimeError: if the layer isn't yet built
        (in which case its weights aren't yet defined).

<h3 id="evaluate"><code>evaluate</code></h3>

    x,
    y,
    batch_size=32,
    verbose=1,
    sample_weight=None
)

    x: Numpy array of test data,
        or list of Numpy arrays if the model has multiple inputs.
        If all inputs in the model are named,
        you can also pass a dictionary
        mapping input names to Numpy arrays.
    y: Numpy array of target data,
        or list of Numpy arrays if the model has multiple outputs.
        If all outputs in the model are named,

        mapping output names to Numpy arrays.
    batch_size: integer. Number of samples per gradient update.
    verbose: verbosity mode, 0 or 1.
    sample_weight: Array of weights to weight the contribution
        of different samples to the loss and metrics.


#### Returns:

    Scalar test loss (if the model has a single output and no metrics)
    or list of scalars (if the model has multiple outputs
    and/or metrics). The attribute `model.metrics_names` will give you
    the display labels for the scalar outputs.

<h3 id="evaluate_generator"><code>evaluate_generator</code></h3>

``` python
evaluate_generator(
    generator,
    steps,
    max_queue_size=10,
    workers=1,
    use_multiprocessing=False,
    **kwargs
)
```

Evaluates the model on a data generator.

The generator should return the same kind of data
as accepted by `test_on_batch`.

#### Arguments:

    generator: Generator yielding tuples (inputs, targets)
        or (inputs, targets, sample_weights)
        or an instance of Sequence (keras.utils.Sequence)

        to yield from `generator` before stopping.
    max_queue_size: maximum size for the generator queue
    workers: maximum number of processes to spin up
        when using process based threading
    use_multiprocessing: if True, use process based threading.
        Note that because
        this implementation relies on multiprocessing,
        you should not pass
        non picklable arguments to the generator
        as they can't be passed
        easily to children processes.
    **kwargs: support for legacy arguments.


#### Returns:

    Scalar test loss (if the model has a single output and no metrics)
    or list of scalars (if the model has multiple outputs
    and/or metrics). The attribute `model.metrics_names` will give you
    the display labels for the scalar outputs.


#### Raises:

    ValueError: In case the generator yields
        data in an invalid format.

<h3 id="fit"><code>fit</code></h3>

``` python
fit(
    x=None,
    y=None,
    batch_size=32,
    epochs=1,
    verbose=1,
    callbacks=None,
    validation_split=0.0,
    validation_data=None,
    shuffle=True,
    class_weight=None,
    sample_weight=None,
    initial_epoch=0
)
```

Trains the model for a fixed number of epochs (iterations on a dataset).

#### Arguments:

    x: Numpy array of training data,
        or list of Numpy arrays if the model has multiple inputs.
        If all inputs in the model are named,
        you can also pass a dictionary
        mapping input names to Numpy arrays.
    y: Numpy array of target data,
        or list of Numpy arrays if the model has multiple outputs.
        If all outputs in the model are named,
        you can also pass a dictionary
        mapping output names to Numpy arrays.
    batch_size: integer. Number of samples per gradient update.
    epochs: integer, the number of times to iterate
        over the training data arrays.
    verbose: 0, 1, or 2. Verbosity mode.
        0 = silent, 1 = verbose, 2 = one log line per epoch.
    callbacks: list of callbacks to be called during training.
        See [callbacks](/callbacks).
    validation_split: float between 0 and 1:
        fraction of the training data to be used as validation data.
        The model will set apart this fraction of the training data,
        will not train on it, and will evaluate
        the loss and any model metrics
        on this data at the end of each epoch.
    validation_data: data on which to evaluate
        the loss and any model metrics
        at the end of each epoch. The model will not
        be trained on this data.
        This could be a tuple (x_val, y_val)
        or a tuple (x_val, y_val, val_sample_weights).
    shuffle: boolean, whether to shuffle the training data
        before each epoch.
    class_weight: optional dictionary mapping
        class indices (integers) to
        a weight (float) to apply to the model's loss for the samples
        from this class during training.
        This can be useful to tell the model to "pay more attention" to
        samples from an under-represented class.
    sample_weight: optional array of the same length as x, containing
        weights to apply to the model's loss for each sample.
        In the case of temporal data, you can pass a 2D array
        with shape (samples, sequence_length),
        to apply a different weight to every timestep of every sample.
        In this case you should make sure to specify
        sample_weight_mode="temporal" in compile().
    initial_epoch: epoch at which to start training
        (useful for resuming a previous training run)


#### Returns:

    A `History` instance. Its `history` attribute contains
    all information collected during training.


#### Raises:

    ValueError: In case of mismatch between the provided input data
        and what the model expects.

<h3 id="fit_generator"><code>fit_generator</code></h3>

``` python
fit_generator(

    max_queue_size=10,
    workers=1,
    use_multiprocessing=False,
    initial_epoch=0,
    **kwargs
)
```

Fits the model on data yielded batch-by-batch by a Python generator.

The generator is run in parallel to the model, for efficiency.
For instance, this allows you to do real-time data augmentation
on images on CPU in parallel to training your model on GPU.

The use of `keras.utils.Sequence` guarantees the ordering
and guarantees the single use of every input per epoch when
using `use_multiprocessing=True`.

#### Arguments:

    generator: a generator or an instance of Sequence (keras.utils.Sequence)
            object in order to avoid duplicate data
            when using multiprocessing.
        The output of the generator must be either
        - a tuple (inputs, targets)
        - a tuple (inputs, targets, sample_weights).
        All arrays should contain the same number of samples.
        The generator is expected to loop over its data
        indefinitely. An epoch finishes when `steps_per_epoch`
        batches have been seen by the model.
    steps_per_epoch: Total number of steps (batches of samples)
        to yield from `generator` before declaring one epoch
        finished and starting the next epoch. It should typically
        be equal to the number of unique samples if your dataset
        divided by the batch size.
    epochs: integer, total number of iterations on the data.
    verbose: verbosity mode, 0, 1, or 2.
    callbacks: list of callbacks to be called during training.
    validation_data: this can be either
        - a generator for the validation data
        - a tuple (inputs, targets)
        - a tuple (inputs, targets, sample_weights).
    validation_steps: Only relevant if `validation_data`
        is a generator. Total number of steps (batches of samples)
        to yield from `generator` before stopping.
    class_weight: dictionary mapping class indices to a weight
        for the class.
    max_queue_size: maximum size for the generator queue
    workers: maximum number of processes to spin up
        when using process based threading
    use_multiprocessing: if True, use process based threading.
        Note that because
        this implementation relies on multiprocessing,
        you should not pass
        non picklable arguments to the generator
        as they can't be passed
        easily to children processes.
    initial_epoch: epoch at which to start training
        (useful for resuming a previous training run)
    **kwargs: support for legacy arguments.


#### Returns:

    A `History` object.

Example:

```python
    def generate_arrays_from_file(path):
        while 1:
            f = open(path)
            for line in f:
                # create numpy arrays of input data
                # and labels, from each line in the file
                x1, x2, y = process_line(line)
                yield ({'input_1': x1, 'input_2': x2}, {'output': y})
            f.close()

    model.fit_generator(generate_arrays_from_file('/my_file.txt'),
                        steps_per_epoch=10000, epochs=10)
```


#### Raises:

    ValueError: In case the generator yields
        data in an invalid format.

<h3 id="get_weights"><code>get_weights</code></h3>

``` python
get_weights()
```

Retrieves the weights of the model.

#### Returns:

    A flat list of Numpy arrays.

<h3 id="load_weights"><code>load_weights</code></h3>

``` python
load_weights(
    filepath,
    by_name=False
)
```

Loads all layer weights from a HDF5 save file.

If `by_name` is False (default) weights are loaded
based on the network's topology, meaning the architecture
should be the same as when the weights were saved.
Note that layers that don't have weights are not taken
into account in the topological ordering, so adding or
removing layers is fine as long as they don't have weights.

If `by_name` is True, weights are loaded into layers
only if they share the same name. This is useful
for fine-tuning or transfer-learning models where
some of the layers have changed.

#### Arguments:

    filepath: String, path to the weights file to load.
    by_name: Boolean, whether to load weights by name
        or by topological order.


#### Raises:

    ImportError: If h5py is not available.

<h3 id="predict"><code>predict</code></h3>

``` python
predict(
    x,
    batch_size=32,
    verbose=0
)
```

Generates output predictions for the input samples.

Computation is done in batches.

#### Arguments:

    x: the input data, as a Numpy array
        (or list of Numpy arrays if the model has multiple outputs).
    batch_size: integer.
    verbose: verbosity mode, 0 or 1.


#### Returns:

    Numpy array(s) of predictions.


#### Raises:

    ValueError: In case of mismatch between the provided
        input data and the model's expectations,
        or in case a stateful model receives a number of samples
        that is not a multiple of the batch size.

<h3 id="predict_generator"><code>predict_generator</code></h3>

``` python
predict_generator(
    generator,
    steps,
    max_queue_size=10,
    workers=1,
    use_multiprocessing=False,
    verbose=0,
    **kwargs
)
```

Generates predictions for the input samples from a data generator.

The generator should return the same kind of data as accepted by
`predict_on_batch`.

#### Arguments:

    generator: Generator yielding batches of input samples
            or an instance of Sequence (keras.utils.Sequence)
            object in order to avoid duplicate data
            when using multiprocessing.
    steps: Total number of steps (batches of samples)
        to yield from `generator` before stopping.
    max_queue_size: Maximum size for the generator queue.
    workers: Maximum number of processes to spin up
        when using process based threading
    use_multiprocessing: If `True`, use process based threading.
        Note that because
        this implementation relies on multiprocessing,
        you should not pass
        non picklable arguments to the generator
        as they can't be passed
        easily to children processes.
    verbose: verbosity mode, 0 or 1.
    **kwargs: support for legacy arguments.


#### Returns:

    Numpy array(s) of predictions.


#### Raises:

    ValueError: In case the generator yields
        data in an invalid format.

<h3 id="predict_on_batch"><code>predict_on_batch</code></h3>

predict_on_batch(x)
```

Returns predictions for a single batch of samples.

#### Arguments:

    x: Input samples, as a Numpy array.

<h3 id="save"><code>save</code></h3>

``` python
save(
    filepath,
    overwrite=True,
    include_optimizer=True
)
```

Save the model to a single HDF5 file.

The savefile includes:
    - The model architecture, allowing to re-instantiate the model.
    - The model weights.
    - The state of the optimizer, allowing to resume training
        exactly where you left off.

This allows you to save the entirety of the state of a model
in a single file.

Saved models can be reinstantiated via `keras.models.load_model`.
The model returned by `load_model`
is a compiled model ready to be used (unless the saved model
was never compiled in the first place).

#### Arguments:

    filepath: String, path to the file to save the weights to.
    overwrite: Whether to silently overwrite any existing file at the
        target location, or provide the user with a manual prompt.
    include_optimizer: If True, save optimizer's state together.

Example:

```python
from keras.models import load_model

model.save('my_model.h5')  # creates a HDF5 file 'my_model.h5'
del model  # deletes the existing model

# returns a compiled model
# identical to the previous one
model = load_model('my_model.h5')
```

<h3 id="save_weights"><code>save_weights</code></h3>

``` python
save_weights(
    filepath,
    overwrite=True
)
```

Dumps all layer weights to a HDF5 file.

The weight file has:
    - `layer_names` (attribute), a list of strings
        (ordered names of model layers).
    - For every layer, a `group` named `layer.name`
        - For every such layer group, a group attribute `weight_names`,
            a list of strings
            (ordered names of weights tensor of the layer).
        - For every weight in the layer, a dataset
            storing the weight value, named after the weight tensor.

#### Arguments:

    filepath: String, path to the file to save the weights to.
    overwrite: Whether to silently overwrite any existing file at the
        target location, or provide the user with a manual prompt.


#### Raises:

    ImportError: If h5py is not available.

<h3 id="set_weights"><code>set_weights</code></h3>

``` python
set_weights(weights)
```

        the output of `model.get_weights()`.

<h3 id="summary"><code>summary</code></h3>

``` python
summary(
    line_length=None,
    positions=None,
    print_fn=None
)
```

Prints a string summary of the network.

#### Arguments:

    line_length: Total length of printed lines
        (e.g. set this to adapt the display to different
        terminal window sizes).
    positions: Relative or absolute positions of log elements
        in each line. If not provided,
        defaults to `[.33, .55, .67, 1.]`.
    print_fn: Print function to use. Defaults to `print`.
        It will be called on each line of the summary.
        You can set it to a custom function
        in order to capture the string summary.

<h3 id="test_on_batch"><code>test_on_batch</code></h3>

``` python
test_on_batch(
    x,
    y,
    sample_weight=None
)
```

    sample_weight: optional array of the same length as x, containing
        weights to apply to the model's loss for each sample.
        In the case of temporal data, you can pass a 2D array
        with shape (samples, sequence_length),
        to apply a different weight to every timestep of every sample.
        In this case you should make sure to specify
        sample_weight_mode="temporal" in compile().


#### Returns:

    Scalar test loss (if the model has a single output and no metrics)
    or list of scalars (if the model has multiple outputs
    and/or metrics). The attribute `model.metrics_names` will give you
    the display labels for the scalar outputs.

<h3 id="to_json"><code>to_json</code></h3>

    sample_weight: optional array of the same length as x, containing
        weights to apply to the model's loss for each sample.
        In the case of temporal data, you can pass a 2D array
        with shape (samples, sequence_length),
        to apply a different weight to every timestep of every sample.
        In this case you should make sure to specify
        sample_weight_mode="temporal" in compile().
    class_weight: optional dictionary mapping
        class indices (integers) to
        a weight (float) to apply to the model's loss for the samples
        from this class during training.
        This can be useful to tell the model to "pay more attention" to
        samples from an under-represented class.


#### Returns:

    Scalar training loss
    (if the model has a single output and no metrics)
