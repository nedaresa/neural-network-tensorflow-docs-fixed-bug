# Module: tf.contrib.kfac.layer_collection



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/kfac/python/ops/layer_collection_lib.py`](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.4/tensorflow/contrib/kfac/python/ops/layer_collection_lib.py).

Registry for layers and their parameters/variables.

This represents the collection of all layers in the approximate Fisher
information matrix to which a particular FisherBlock may belong. That is, we
might have several layer collections for one TF graph (if we have multiple K-FAC
optimizers being used, for example.)

## Classes

[`class LayerCollection`](../../../tf/contrib/kfac/layer_collection/LayerCollection): Registry of information about layers and losses.

[`class LayerParametersDict`](../../../tf/contrib/kfac/layer_collection/LayerParametersDict): An OrderedDict where keys are Tensors or tuples of Tensors.
