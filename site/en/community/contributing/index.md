# The TensorFlow Contributor Community

The TensorFlow ecosystem is only able to grow via the contributions of its community. Thanks so much for your enthusiasm and your work! We appreciate everything you do.

## Community Values

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Examples of behaviors that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

*   Using **welcoming and inclusive** language.
*   Being **respectful** of differing viewpoints and experiences.
*   Gracefully accepting **constructive criticism**.
*   Fostering what is **best for the community**.
*   **Showing empathy** for other community members.

Decisions are made based on technical merit and consensus. We aspire to treat everyone equally, and to value all contributions. For more information on best practices in the TensorFlow community, please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


## Who is a contributor?

A contributor is anyone who gives time and effort to improving TensorFlow. Here are some of the ways that people can contribute:

* Write, review or test code
* Write or edit documentation
* Answer questions on StackOverflow
* Report or investigate bugs
* Participate in the mailing list or discussion forum
* Reference TensorFlow in blogs, papers, articles and talks
* Talk about TensorFlow on social media
* Star the TensorFlow repo on GitHub

The TensorFlow contributor community spans the globe, and includes many types of people with a wide range of expertise and skills.

We're excited to have you here, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the project! This is an exciting time to be working on  deep learning, and it's only just beginning.


### How to become a contributor

Different types of contribution require different types of effort and skill, as well as different levels of commitment. 

For example, if you'd like tweet about how you're using TensorFlow in your own projects just do it. Congratulations, you're a part of the community! Nobody has to approve your membership.

If you're interested in contributing more directly to TensorFlow code, documentation, or official community resources, this guide provides information on our processes and community norms. Community members contributing to these projects are expected to follow these processes and adhere to these norms.

The TensorFlow ecosystem is only able to grow via the contributions of its community. Thanks so much for your enthusiasm and your work! We appreciate everything you do.

## The TensorFlow Ecosystem

The TensorFlow community includes all the people working on and contributing to TensorFlow and the many related projects.

### What is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is an open-source software library for high performance numerical computation. Its flexible architecture allows for easy deployment of algorithms and code across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs) — and from desktops, to clusters of servers, to mobile and edge devices. 

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers from the Google Brain team within [Google's AI organization](https://ai.google/). Google open-sourced TensorFlow in the hope of sharing technology with the external community and encouraging collaboration between researchers and industry. Since then, TensorFlow has grown into a thriving ecosystem of products, on a wide range of platforms. But our goal is still to make machine learning accessible to anyone, anywhere.

### TensorFlow Projects

Here is an incomplete list of TensorFlow projects.

*   [TensorFlow Core](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
*   [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift)
*   [Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models)
*   [TensorBoard](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard)
*   [TensorFlow.js](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-core)
