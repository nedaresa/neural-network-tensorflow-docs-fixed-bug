        "In this tutorial we will discuss how to classify cats vs dogs images by using transfer learning from a pre-trained network. This will allows us to get higher accuracies than we saw by training our network from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "A **pre-trained model **is a saved network that was previously trained on a large dataset, typically on a large-scale image-classification task. We can either use the pretrained model as it is or transfer learning using the pretrained convents. The intuition behind **transfer learning **is that if this model trained on a large and general enough dataset, this model will effectively serve as a generic model of the visual world. We can leverage these learned feature maps without having to train a large model on a large dataset by using these models as the basis of our own model specific to our task. There are 2 scenarios of transfer learning using a pretrained model:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Feature Extraction** - use the representations of learned by a previous network to extract meaningful features from new samples. We simply add a new classifier, which will be trained from scratch, on top of the pretrained model so that we can repurpose the feature maps learned previously for our dataset. **Do we use the entire pretrained model or just the convolutional base?** - We use the feature extraction portion of these pretrained convnets (convolutional base) since they are likely to be generic features and learned concepts over a picture. However, the classification part of the pretrained model is often specific to original classification task, and subsequently specific to the set of classes on which the model was trained. \n",
        "2. **Fine-Tuning** - unfreezing a few of the top layers of a frozen model base used for feature extraction, and jointly training both the newly added classifier layers as well as the last layers of the frozen model. This allows us to \"fine tune\" the higher order feature representations in addition to our final classifier in order to make them more relevant for the specific task involved. \n",
        "\n",
        "**We will follow the general machine learning workflow:**\n",
        "1. Examine and understand data\n",
        "2. Build an input pipeline - using Keras ImageDataGenerator as we did in the image classification tutorial\n",
        "3. Compose our model \n",
        "  * Load in our pretrained model (and pretrained weights)\n",
        "  * Stack our classification layers on top\n",
        "4. Train our model\n",
        "5. Evaluate model\n",
        "\n",
        "We will see an example of using the pre-trained convnet as the feature extraction and then fine-tune to train the last few layers of the base model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Audience:** This post is geared towards beginners with some Keras API and ML background. To get the most out of this post, you should have some basic ML background, know what CNNs are, and be familiar with the Keras Sequential API.  \n",

One way to increase performance even further is to \"fine-tune\" the weights of the top layers of the pre-trained model alongside the training of the top-level classifier. The training process will force the weights to be tuned from generic features maps to features associated specifically to our dataset.\n",
